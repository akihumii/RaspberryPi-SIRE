Change keyboard layout: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=9136#p106790

Use the command:
	sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
to reconfigure your keyboard. Choose English (US) for keyboard layout (second page of configuration). Then either reboot or
	invoke-rc.d keyboard-setup start
to reload the keymap.

Connect to wifi:

Soft-blocking
The output to sudo rfkill list shows that your network card is "soft-blocked".

This could happen when the wireless card has been signalled to switch-off via the kernel.

Try the following steps:
run in a terminal:
sudo rfkill unblock wifi; sudo rfkill unblock all
rerun sudo rfkill list to confirm that the card has been unblocked.
reboot
rerun sudo rfkill list again to confirm unblocking as been retained.
rerun sudo lshw -class network - you should now see that the kernel has recognised (or not) the wireless card.

If the wireless kernel module has been recognised (it should not say "unclaimed"), Network Manager should now be able to see wireless networks that are available in your vacinity.

Configure RPi to Access Point mode:
https://github.com/SurferTim/documentation/blob/6bc583965254fa292a470990c40b145f553f6b34/configuration/wireless/access-point.md
	*TAKE NOTE*: REMOVE driver=nl80211 from /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf


Remove disk checking feature (speed up boot up time): https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=61821&p=459652
	Edit your /etc/fstab and set any file systems you don't want checked to have a 0 in the 6th (last) field.

Compiling MAX3107 driver: https://gist.github.com/fenrir-naru/95669cb8fcbf14c22e59#file-gistfile1-sh-l12
https://github.com/notro/rpi-source/wiki/Examples-on-how-to-build-various-modules#hello-world-example

Install rpi-source:
https://github.com/notro/rpi-source/wiki

Get max310x.c from: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/tty/serial/max310x.c

Write a makefile:
MODSRC=/home/pi/max310x
obj-m+=max310x.o

all:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=${MODSRC} modules

clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=${MODSRC} clean

To configure Raspberry pi to have Static IP Address:
Edit /etc/dhcpcd.conf: Add the following lines to the end of the file:

interface wlan0
static ip_address=192.168.137.74/24
static routers=192.168.137.1
static domain_name_servers=192.168.137.1

Disable BT:
https://scribles.net/disabling-bluetooth-on-raspberry-pi/
Disabling on-board Bluetooth
The steps below shows how to disable on-board Bluetooth and related services. Those steps also disable loading the related kernel modules such as bluetooth, hci_uart, btbcm, etc at boot.

1. Open /boot/config.txt file.
	sudo nano /boot/config.txt
2. Add below, save and close the file.
	# Disable Bluetooth
	dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt

3. Disable related services.
	sudo systemctl disable hciuart.service
	sudo systemctl disable bluealsa.service
	sudo systemctl disable bluetooth.service
4. Reboot to apply the changes
	sudo reboot
Even after disabling on-board Bluetooth and related services, Bluetooth will be available when a Bluetooth adapter is plugged in.

Note: change the arm_freq to 1400, arm_freq_min=100, and temp_soft_limit=70 in /boot/config.txt

Install Numba:
To install numba, it'll be easier to use Berryconda for the python environment.
https://github.com/jjhelmus/berryconda
It is an Anaconda-based envirionment, so we can install the packages like how we install anaconda packages.
conda install -c anaconda pandas 
conda install -c anaconda numpy 
conda install -c numba numba
conda install -c anaconda scipy 
conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn 
conda install -c poppy-project rpi.gpio
